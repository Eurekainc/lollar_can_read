# Rails Test Prescriptions
Prescription_1
Use the TDD process to create and adjust your code’s design in small, incremental steps

Prescription_2
In a test-driven process, if it is difficult to write tests for a feature, strongly consider the possibility that the underlying code needs to be changed.

Prescription_3
Initializing objects is a good starting place for a TDD process.  Another good approach is to use the test to design what you want a successful interaction of the feature to look like.

Prescription_4
When possible, write your tests to describe your code’s behavior, not its implementation.

Prescription_5
Keeping your code as simple as possible allows you to focus complexity on the areas that really need complexity.

Prescription_6
Choose your test data and test-variable names to make it easy to diagnose failures when they happen.  Meaningful names and data that doesn’t overlap are helpful.
